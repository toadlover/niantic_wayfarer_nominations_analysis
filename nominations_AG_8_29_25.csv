Based on old Rolla Express newspaper ads, it was in existence past 1862. Available records point to a less than reliable past. During its first fifty years, the bridge was condemned and rebuilt at least three times by Frisco crews. Despite ""bad press"", the bridge served more than a functional purpose for the citizens of Rolla. Touted as ""Rolla's greatest summer resort' it served as a location for individuals to congregate to enjoy the breezes, a rendezvous point for couples in love and a setting for summer concerts for the ""Old Town"". In 1997 Burlington Northern proposed removing the bridge to eliminate further maintenance of the structure. However, at the request of the City of Rolla, the two organizations partnered to convert the bridge to a pedestrianwalk bridge, thus saving one of Rolla's last remaining Civil War era landmarks.","37.946905","-91.772692","Rolla","MO","2018-10-09","75","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1mVWHWSTJ21_EDqtH70uLPw4luYqEiAFBcTznjVTkRh-UCzICrWNyGLQum0geLcSX_0Wjf3OZSZmOpWG_d9nKmyYqdY","","ACCEPTED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The object in question does not meet the Wayfarer criteria.

","To whom it may concern. I am requesting an appeal for this waypoint nomination because I feel that it qualifies as a visually unique mural that is culturally significant to the Chesterfield area. The mural is located at the entrance to a Walmart. As stated in the waypoint description, the images depicted in the letters are from local attractions, encouraging exploration to the surrounding area (and this waypoint description helps to point players in the direction of where to go to see these locations). This mural is one of a series of town murals in local Walmarts, with each mural depicting a scene of its respective town (such as another in Eureka, MO, that I saw while reviewing). Regarding its permanence, this mural has been around since the Walmart was remodeled in ~2018. As for its access to the public, it is located at the entrance to Walmart, making it easy to access on foot. Being located in a large chain like this should not disqualify it either, as it fits all waypoint criteria of visual uniqueness, local cultural significance, permanence, and safe access.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

My submission was rejected on the grounds of being a temporary or seasonal display. However, this is not the case. This is a permanent art installation on the side of a restaurant. The waypoint submission is of painted wood cutouts of popular tv characters (from the show “The Office”) that are permanently bolted to the side of a warehouse on the grounds of the restaurant. The has significance in the show in that it is a location featured in a handful of episodes of the show. Further, the restaurant has an official gift shop for the show (as verified here: https://g.page/TheOfficeGiftShop?share ). The restaurant only recently started to incorporate the show into its theme recently (starting around 2019). With that, the piece of art that I submitted as a waypoint was installed in early 2021 as a means to help advertise the gift shop, as there is no other external advertisement of the TV show on the grounds of the restaurant. I hope you consider this extra context to help indicate that this was a permanent art installation that qualifies somewhere between a mural and sculpture (both of which are valid waypoint candidates). The visual uniqueness holds up in that these are handcrafted, and therefore unique (as well as of popular television characters). For cultural significance, this holds up in that, again, these are characters of a popular television show. Regarding pedestrian access, anyone can safely walk up the railing and on to the deck to reach out and touch these, if they truly wanted to.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We recommend you review the Wayspot Criteria before submitting your next Wayspot contribution: https://niantic.helpshift.com/hc/en/21-wayfarer/","To whom it may concern, I highly recommend overturning this rejection. The nominated waypoint is the 2 depicted fire hydrants, which are painted in the colors of the 2 most popular college sports teams in Alabama, University of Alabama (red and white) and University of Auburn (blue and orange). These fire hydrants are on the grounds of an animal hospital/pet boarding and grooming facility. They are intended for dogs to pee on and are not actually a part of Selma's water system (a fire truck would not use this). Due to the nature of the property that these are on, they are at a public business that does not block any sort of emergency services. The ruling that this is on a private residence or farm is completely ridiculous, as this is located on the grounds of a public business (the voting activity of anyone who selected this should be investigated for fraudulent voting). Ultimately, this qualifies as a fire hydrant and painting under waypoint acceptance criteria.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was the 50-mile march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, the State Capital. Defying threats of death, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., led 400 Black and White Americans on the longest, largest, most dramatic march of his 13-year career. It gave southern Blacks the right as citizens to cast a ballot and help determine and help operate the government under which they live. In the succeeding 10 years, Black voters increased from 1,463,000 to 3,845,000 and Black elected officials from 72 to 2,568 in the states affected. Hundreds of others were named to public post. Blacks attained a more equitable share of tax benefits and won greater self esteem and respect from other as voting citizens. All these things flowed from what began here. This is a tribute to those who planned, encouraged, marched, were jailed, beaten and died to change Black Americans from second class to first class citizens. They Gave Their Lives to overcome injustice and secure the right to vote for all Americans. James J. Reeb Boston Viola Gregg Liuzzo Detroit  Jimmy Lee Jackson Marion, Alabama Dedicated August 11, 1979 This was the starting point of the march from Selma to Montgomery March 21, 1965 Project Conceived and Edited by Executive Secretary Robert H.

C. Huckabee of Newbern, Alabama, constructed a furnace here and poured the first iron in November 1862. Within a year, the Confederate government purchased the works and completed a second and larger furnace alongside whose stack exists today. Known as the Bibb Naval Works, the facility was a major contributor of iron used for Confederate ordnance especially the Brooke cannon. <br><br> On the morning of 31 March 1865, Union General James H. Wilson’s 10th Missouri Cavalry wrecked these furnaces and a rolling mill 2 &#189; miles east. After the Civil War, former Confederate Ordnance Bureau Chief Josiah Gorgas (later Vice-Chancellor of the University of the South at Sewanee and President of the University of Alabama) acquired the works from the United States Freedman’s Bureau. The Brierfield Iron Works Company was organized, and after extensive repairs, the furnaces reopened. These efforts failed and in 1869 the furnaces and rolling mill were leased to Thomas S. Alvis, a Gorgas subordinate, whose business collapsed during the Panic of 1873. The furnaces remained idle until 1881. <br><br> Thomas Jefferson Peter, the former general manager of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad, organized the Brierfield Coal & Iron Company and operated the works through most of the 1880s while adding coal mines and coke ovens. A post office was established here named Furnace, and the nearby town of Brierfield was called the &#8220;Magic City of Bibb County.&#8221; Peter went bankrupt in 1889 and reorganized as the Alabama Iron & Steel Company. The furnace and rolling mill worked intermittently until just before Christmas 1894 when all operations ceased forever.","33.039093","-86.948442","Brierfield","LIVE","Mar 19, 2023",""

In this case, I would hope you do your due diligence and at the very least look around the area on streetview to confirm the building exists. This street view along Pike Street best shows where the mural is now painted: https://maps.app.goo.gl/GWwehs5aBD2cvGWcA?g_st=ac

Context clues from the photo and supplementary photo help confirm this.

The mural itself is of an old advertisement for flint corn, which is a historic and significant crop found in Rhode Island. I go further in my description to note its significance and historical tie. I hope between helping prove the existence of the mural and relaying its significance, that you can see that this is a notable waypoint that promotes culture and exploration.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What would actually qualify under that category if this can not? This is not a chain business, and is instead a family owned and operated market. What makes Minas Market unique is that it primarily contains offerings from Brazilian businesses and showcases Brazilian culture. It also serves fresh Brazilian foods (cheese bread, acai smoothies, guava paste, etc), acting as a mini restaurant. Ultimately, this is a hidden gem in the culturally diverse Quinsigamond Village neighborhood of Worcester, and this is a location that encourages exploration and socialization.","","","","","","","","","","","",""
